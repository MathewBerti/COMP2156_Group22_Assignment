A DevOps engineer plays a crucial role in the software development cycle by bridging the gap between development and operations teams. 
They facilitate collaboration, automate processes, and ensure the smooth integration of code changes into production environments. 
DevOps engineers implement practices like continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring to streamline development workflows, 
improve efficiency, and enhance the reliability of software releases. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement and automation, 
they enable faster delivery of high-quality software while minimizing downtime and risks.

Additionally, DevOps engineers are responsible for 
identifying bottlenecks in the development process and implementing 
solutions to improve productivity and scalability
